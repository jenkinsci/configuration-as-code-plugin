# credentials plugin

Requires `credentials` >= 2.2.0

All values with `"${SOME_SECRET}"` is resolved by our Secret Sources Resolver you can [read more about which sources are supported](../../docs/features/secrets.adoc#secret-sources)

Since JCasC version v1.42 we have added support for variable expansion for `base64`, `readFileBase64` and `readFile`
[Read more about the syntax](../../docs/features/secrets.adoc#passing-secrets-through-variables)

You can also see an [example below](#example)

## Sample Configuration

```yaml
credentials:
  system:
    domainCredentials:
      - domain:
          name: "test.com"
          description: "test.com domain"
          specifications:
            - hostnameSpecification:
                includes: "*.test.com"
        credentials:
          - usernamePassword:
              scope: SYSTEM
              id: sudo_password
              username: root
              password: "${SUDO_PASSWORD}"
```

## Example

              fileName: "mysecretfile.txt"
              secretBytes: "${base64:${readFile:${SECRET_FILE_PATH}}}" # secretBytes requires base64 encoded content
          - file:
              scope: GLOBAL
              id: "secret-file_via_binary_file"

              secretBytes: "${readFileBase64:${SECRET_FILE_PATH}}" # secretBytes requires base64 encoded content

              keyStoreSource:
                uploaded:
                  uploadedKeystore: "${readFileBase64:${SECRET_CERT_FILE_PATH}}" # uploadedKeystore requires BINARY base64 encoded content
```

## implementation note

Credentials plugin support relies on a custom adaptor components `CredentialsRootConfigurator` and `SystemCredentialsProviderConfigurator`.

Global credentials can be registered by just not providing a domain (i.e `null`).

Credentials symbol name is inferred from implementation class simple name: `UsernamePasswordCredentialsImpl`
descriptor's clazz is `Credentials`
we consider the `Impl` suffix as a common pattern to flag implementation class.
=> symbol name is `usernamePassword`
