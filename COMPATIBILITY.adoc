= Plugin Compatibility with configuration-as-code plugin

This document captures the ongoing status of plugins known to be compatible or incompatible.

Because of how the tool was designed, plugins _should_ be expected to work out of the box if they followed the main patterns in place.

There is a list of already known issues in the Jenkins issue tracker, tracked through using the label `jcasc-incompatible` (link:https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=17346[see dashboard]).

This document is an *ongoing* community effort.
Hence a missing plugin here and has no existing issue filed in JIRA (see above) does not _necessarily_ mean it won't work.
If you tested it and know it works, please file a PR to fix the status and inform the other users.
Thanks!
