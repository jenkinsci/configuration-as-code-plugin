# Plugin Compatibility issues with Configuration as Code plugin

Often JCasC is not the one having issues with configuring a plugin.
Because of how the JCasC was designed, plugins _should_ be expected to work out of the box if they followed the main patterns in place.
We rely heavily on data bindings so if a plugin is not setup according to expected design pattern for data binding.

JCasC cannot communicate properly with the plugin without fixing their data binding issues or writing a special configurator.
The path of least resistance is fixing the data binding, since other plugins in the Jenkins eco-system rely heavily on data binding.

The list of already known issues in the Jenkins issue tracker, are tracked through using the label `jcasc-compatibility` [see dashboard][dashboard].

## Reporting Plugin Compatibility issue
